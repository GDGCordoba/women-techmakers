This repo is intended to be used as a template for future Women TechMakers (WTM) events as landing page. Thanks to [GDG CÃ³rdoba]() for sharing it with us :)

To develop it in a local environment `git clone` it, then run `npm i` in the root folder to install all required packages. To start the development server, run `idk-which-command-to-use`.

**Beware**: you need Python 2 for `npm i` to work (sadly :( gyp needs it as hard dependency)
